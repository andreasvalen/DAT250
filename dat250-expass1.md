### Technical problems

1. Adding enviromentar variables via console did not work as described

- Solved: Added manually in via the windows GUI

2. Could not echo enviromental variables in MINGW64 or powershell.

- Solved: Worked in cmd terminal. We're able to echo with different syntax ($ instead of %%)

3. heroku pg would not update amount of rows over 2

- Partially solved: Connecting to the db via the 'heroku pg:psql' command, displayed the correct number of rows

4. Could not connect to local db

- UNSOLVED

5. Could not set heroku config variable

- Solved: Again the solution was to use the cmd terminal. The error seems to be related to a bad path.
