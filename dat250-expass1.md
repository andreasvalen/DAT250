# Technical problems

- Adding enviromentar variables via console did not work as described
  Solved: Added manually in via the windows GUI

- Could not echo enviromental variables in MINGW64 or powershell.
  Solved: Worked in cmd terminal. We're able to echo with different syntax ($ instead of %%)

- heroku pg would not update amount of rows over 2
  Partially solved: Connecting to the db via the 'heroku pg:psql' command, displayed the correct number of rows

- Could not connect to local db
  UNSOLVED

- Could not set heroku config variable
  Solved: Again the solution was to use the cmd terminal. The error seems to be related to a bad path.
