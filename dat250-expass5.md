# Excercise 

### Report

## Experiment 1

Everything went smooth with the quickstart

## Experiment 2

Tutorial went ok.
It was a bit annoying to install Spring Boot CLI because the SDKMAN needed access to a zip tool so I had to add it to the mingw64's bin folder manually.

## Experiment 3

The rest tutorial went ok. I noticed that if I ran the program in a powershell terminal, the tasks would terminate automatically, but in mingw64 i needed to kill the task manually:

The jar file that was created was given a different name than it said in the tutorial, so the command had to be moidified slightly:
